# WpDateTime Classes
Offbeat has a WpDateTime and WpDateTimeImmitable class. These extend the DateTime and DateTimeImmutable PHP classes.

## Default Timezone
By default, the WpDateTime classes uses the website's timezone rather than UTC.

## Error Handling
The DateTime and DateTimeImmuteable classes were introduced before PHP had proper error handling implemented.
As such, some methods will return FALSE when called incorrectly.
The WpDateTime class will throw an Exception if a method such as DateTime->modify is called incorrectly.

## Date Formatting
WpDateTime->i18n(string $format = ''): string
The i18n method will return the formatted date, in the same way that calling wp_date would.
It uses the format defined in Wordpress' read-settings, but you can specify a different format in the first parameter.

## Helper Methods
WpDateTime has several helpful get/set methods to make it easier to adjust the date.
